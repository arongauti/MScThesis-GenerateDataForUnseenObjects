  %% Using a robot to generate training data for previously unseen objects

A robot is a machine that is often used to do human work in a much more precise and efficient way than the human himself and more difficult situations. Robots can increase flexibility in the production environment by assisting in a working area. One of the benefits is that the robots have high accuracy and can handle heavy and hot objects. Robots can be a good replacement for current human labor and can easily replace staff. As a result, increased efficiency due to robotics will boost worker well-being by increasing wages and providing more leisure time.

Picking unseen items is a required skill for robots to learn, it enables them to achieve more general-purpose usefulness. To visually find the best picking point for a given object, such general-purpose robots can use their perception abilities.

To compare this process with human beings, it can be pointed out that it takes a child around 3-6 months to achieve good eyesight on an object and coordinate it. Then it can take around 6-12 months for the child to be able to choose an object, knowing what it is, and know-how to pick it up. It is therefore interesting to see how long it will take a robot with the help of a computer vision to learn these things and pick up an unseen object. 

For a robot to pick up unseen objects the robot would need to look at the object, find outlines of the object, a flat surface, and find the center point of the object by using an existing neural network. Assuming the robot has a single point of view of a bin filled with unseen items. When the center point has been found the robot can pick up the object with a suction cup. The robot would then need to place the object in a new place in the bin and take a new photo and train the neural network. However, a part of the problem is to determine suitable methods for picking, arranging, and labelling. The object detection would be done using methods of deep learning. This process is intended to reduce the manual registration effort associated with introducing new objects for automatic picking and packing


The main objective for this project is therefore to use a robot manipulator to generate training data for previously unseen objects. Three smaller objectives will be considered in this project. First, to create object labels by automatically determining the size of the objects in the images. Second, generate new arrangements of objects using a robot manipulator to train a network to handle the new objects. The third one is to measure the accuracy of object detection using a deep neural network trained on the robot-generated data.

\subsection{Bin picking}
Since the development of the first industrial robot, the automation of handling tasks has been an important scientific topic. In this context, one of the examples is the so-called “bin picking” problem. For humans, it is an easy task to pick up objects in a box, but it can be a very complex task for robots. Bin picking contains several subsections, including, scene analysis, object recognition, object localization, grasp planning, and path planning \cite{buchholz_bin-picking_2015}. Besides, robots must be able to grasp objects in an infinite number of directions and reach deep into the corners of the bin, at the same time avoiding collisions\cite{truebenbach_is_2019}.

Bin picking can be divided into three categories: \textit{Structured bin picking}, \textit{Semi-structured Bin picking}, and \textit{Random Bin picking}. The main difference between those categories is the difficulty level. In \textit{Structured bin picking} objects are placed in an organized pattern so that they can be identified and picked up effortlessly. In \textit{Semi-structured Bin picking} objects are placed with some organization to make picking easier. Finally, in the \textit{Random Bin picking}, objects have completely random positions, multiple directions, and can also overlap each other \cite{noauthor_robotworx_nodate}.

For the bin picking to be fully automated it requires many technologies to work together. Including, a 3D model of the object, the bin, the robot end effector, the placement. Also, a model of ways to pick up the objects with the end effector and deposit it at the placement target. A 3D sensor to map the bin, image analysis software to locate each object and obstacles in the bin, path planning software to avoid collisions. Finally, a robot control software to maneuver the robot \cite{truebenbach_is_2019}.


In the setup and programming, there does the teaching takes place e.g. how to pick up an object, where to put it down, obstacles to avoid, etc. The trickiest challenge for bin picking is path planning. To plan a unique, collision-free path for each object in the bin to the placement target. Path planning is the main determinant of system reliability because if it is not done well enough the objects can be dropped, left out in the bin, or missed targets and there can be collisions \cite{truebenbach_is_2019}.





\subsection{Computer Vision}
%% Úr bók A Guided Tour of computer vision.
The automatic deduction of the structure and properties of a possible complex three-dimensional universe from either a single or several two-dimensional representations of the world is known as computer vision or image comprehension. Computer vision is used to deduce the structure and properties of the three-dimensional universe, which include not only geometric properties but also material properties and the lighting of the world. The lightness or darkness of surfaces, their colors, textures, and material compositions are examples of geometric properties. Whereas the forms, sizes, and locations of objects are examples of material properties \cite{nalwa_what_1993}. % úr bók af bókasafni

Parallel to this, computer vision researchers have been working on mathematical methods for restoring the three-dimensional form and appearance of objects in images. Designers now have effective methods for constructing a partial 3D model of an area from thousands of partially overlapping images. Designers can construct accurate dense 3D surface models using stereo matching if they have a wide enough collection of views of a particular object or facade. Designers can also follow a person's movements with a complex background. It is also possible to use a combination of face, clothes, and hair identification and recognition, to find and name all of the people in an image with moderate success. \cite{szeliski_introduction_2010}.

Computer vision is a branch of computer science that aims to replicate aspects of the complexity of the human vision system, allowing computers to recognize and process objects in images and videos in the same way that human eyes do. Pattern recognition is at the heart of computer vision. One method of teaching a computer to understand visual data is to feed it thousands of images, if not millions, of labeled images. Then subject the images to various software techniques, or algorithms, that allow the computer to search for patterns in all the elements that relate to those labels \cite{mihajlovic_everything_nodate}.

The poster child of artificial intelligence is computer vision technology. Because of the resources and opportunities that technology can bring, this is the business area that attracts the most media coverage. From self-driving cars and drones to cancer detection and augmented reality, technologies that were once only seen in science fiction are now more accessible and available to us \cite{ambalina_5_2020}.




\subsubsection*{Edge detection} 
An image edge is a contour along which the image intensity suddenly changes and an image-intensity edge may or may not correlate to a physical edge of an object. The Canny operator is a common edge detection operator that uses Gaussian smoothing. When the gradient magnitude exceeds a certain threshold, it detects edges at the zero-crossing of the smoothed image's second directional derivative in the direction of the gradient. Canny's filter is derived by optimizing a particular performance index that favors true positives, true negatives, and accurate localization of detected edges \cite{nalwa_edge_1993}.

\subsubsection*{Convolutional neural network}

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a deep learning algorithm which is most applied to analyzing visual images, assign importance to various objects in the image and to differentiate one from the other. In CNN the pre-processing is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. But then CNN has the ability to learn filters with enough training, for example to understand the refinement of the image better. CNN advantages includes that it can successfully capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters.


CNN was inspired by the organization of the visual cortex and of the connectivity pattern of neurons in the human brain.

\subsection{Robots}
Robots are getting smarter day by day and people wonder how much we can trust them in the industry. Collaborative Robots (Cobots) are more modern advances in which robots operate alongside humans rather than replacing them \cite{pickett_dont_2018}. 

Cobots assist operators by growing their capacities in terms of effort, enabling them to handle parts that are hot, heavy, bulky, or too fragile for precision handling. Besides, cobots are easier to program than industrial robots because they are capable of learning new jobs \cite{schmidbauer_teaching_2020}. A factory worker can easily re-program cobot, simply by moving his arm along the desired track. From there the cobot would learn the new movement and be able to replicate it on his own. Industrial robots can not be reprogrammed as easily and require the engineer to write a new code for any improvements in the process to be implemented.

Industrial automation is capable of achieving high productivity and repeatability in mass manufacturing. However, there is a lack of flexibility to overcome the uncertainties of workspaces arising from mass customization \cite{accorsi_application_2019}. Although humans can cope with such uncertainties and variability in such circumstances, their physical capacities are constrained in terms of repeatability, physical power, endurance, speed, etc. These constraints also lead to decreased performance and productivity. Therefore, a combination of automation and versatility is required to meet these overall manufacturing objectives through mass customization \cite{el_zaatari_cobot_2019}.   

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Robot Modeling:}
A mathematical representation must be built in order to generate trajectories and tasks for robots. This includes a model of the robot's geometry, mechanics, and electrical components. The mathematical model is developed in order to create a quantitative relationship between the sudden shift and the magnitude of the collision. The latter is represented by either an external impulsive force or an instantaneous change in the contact point's linear velocity. Second, as a result of the collision, large impulsive forces and constraint torques may develop within the system at each joint. These impulses have the ability to affect the system. A mathematical model is also established in order to create a quantitative relationship between the impulsive forces and torquest of constraint and collision.  \cite{zheng_mathematical_1985}.

Robotic Manipulators are composed of two merged things, links and joints that forms a kinematic chain. In this context, links are the rigid sections that make up the mechanism and joints are the connection between two links. The kinematic manipulator chain is a combination of several cinematic pairs and the pair is a combination of two links connected by joint \cite{al-naimi_robotics_nodate}.

\subsection{Robot Operating System (ROS)}
Robot Operating System (ROS) is a open source flexible framework for developing robot applications. It is a set of software, libraries, and conventions aimed at making the challenge of developing dynamic and robust robot actions over a wide range of robotic platforms easier. ROS is not a conventional operating system in the context of process control and scheduling \cite{quigley_ros_2009}. ROS offers package processing, message services between devices, and a variety of libraries. ROS supports a variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, and Javascript. ROS has over 3000 packages available, including robot drivers, computer vision libraries, navigation applications, and many more.

    \label{fig:rosmaster}
\end{figure}

The \textbf{ROS Master} offers name and registration services to the other ROS nodes. It follows the topics and resources of the publishers and subscribers. The job of the master is to allow the location of individual ROS nodes. After these nodes are placed, they interact peer-to-peer\cite{noauthor_master_nodate}. An example of an ROS master can been seen in Figure \ref{fig:rosmaster}.


\textbf{ROS nodes} are modules of the program which execute an operation. 
The nodes are autonomous and can be programmed in a programming language while also communicating in a different language with other nodes\cite{noauthor_rostutorialsunderstandingnodes_nodate}. An example of an ROS nodes can been seen in Figure \ref{fig:rosmaster}.


The \textbf{ROS topics} are called buses that exchange messages across nodes. Anonymous subjects have semantics publish/subscribe that decouple data output from consumption. Nodes are not generally aware of who they talk to. Instead, nodes interested in data subscribe to the subject concerned and nodes which generate information publish on the theme concerned. Many publishers and subscribers may participate in an issue\cite{noauthor_topics_nodate}. An example of an ROS topic can been seen in Figure \ref{fig:rosmaster}.

A set of software package integrated with the ROS and designed specifically to be aware of their surroundings and avoid collisions with humans and other obstacles is called \textbf{MoveIt!}. By using data fused from 3-D and other sensors, MoveIt! will allow robots to build up a representation of their environment. Also, generate motion plans that effectively and safely move the robot around in the environment, and execute the motion plans while constantly monitoring the environment for changes. In other words, MoveIt! is an evolution arm navigation packages which were designed for motion planning and to create trajectories for simple paths with single goal pose. MoveIt! provides a framework for e.g., manipulation, kinematics, and motion planning. To calculate inverse and forward kinematics for path planning, and MoveIt packages it uses URDF robot descriptions. Configurations can then be created using the MoveIt set up assistant \cite{chitta_moveitros_2012}.
