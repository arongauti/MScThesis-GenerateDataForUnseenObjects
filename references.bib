	abstract = {In pattern recognition, information retrieval and classification (machine learning), precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. Both precision and recall are therefore based on relevance.
Suppose a computer program for recognizing dogs (the relevant element) in photographs identifies eight dogs in a picture containing ten cats and twelve dogs, and of the eight it identifies as dogs, five actually are dogs (true positives), while the other three are cats (false positives). Seven dogs were missed (false negatives), and seven cats were correctly excluded (true negatives). The program's precision is then 5/8 (true positives / all positives) while its recall is 5/12 (true positives / relevant elements).
When a search engine returns 30 pages, only 20 of which are relevant, while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3, which tells us how valid the results are, while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3, which tells us how complete the results are.
Adopting a hypothesis-testing approach from statistics, in which, in this case, the null hypothesis is that a given item is irrelevant, i.e., not a dog, absence of type I and type II errors (i.e. perfect specificity and sensitivity of 100\% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative).  
More generally, recall is simply the complement of the type II error rate, i.e., one minus the type II error rate. Precision is related to the type I error rate, but in a slightly more complicated way, as it also depends upon the prior distribution of seeing a relevant vs an irrelevant item.
The above cat and dog example contained 8 − 5 = 3 type I errors, for a type I error rate of 3/10, and 12 − 5 = 7 type II errors, for a type II error rate of 7/12.  Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. 
Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).},

	abstract = {Empirical studies of retrieval performance have shown a tendency for Precision to decline as Recall increases. This article examines the nature of the relationship between Precision and Recall. The relationships between Recall and the number of documents retrieved, between Precision and the number of documents retrieved, and between Precision and Recall are described in the context of different assumptions about retrieval performance. It is demonstrated that a tradeoff between Recall and Precision is unavoidable whenever retrieval performance is consistently better than retrieval at random. More generally, for the Precision–Recall trade-off to be avoided as the total number of documents retrieved increases, retrieval performance must be equal to or better than overall retrieval performance up to that point. Examination of the mathematical relationship between Precision and Recall shows that a quadratic Recall curve can resemble empirical Recall–Precision behavior if transformed into a tangent parabola. With very large databases and/or systems with limited retrieval capabilities there can be advantages to retrieval in two stages: Initial retrieval emphasizing high Recall, followed by more detailed searching of the initially retrieved set, can be used to improve both Recall and Precision simultaneously. Even so, a tradeoff between Precision and Recall remains. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Position based visual servo control requires the explicit calculation of the relative position and orientation (POSE) of the workpiece object with respect to the camera. This is accomplished using image plane measurements of a number of known feature points on the object, and then applying an extended Kalman filter to obtain a recursive solution of the photogrammetric equations, and to properly combine redundant measurements. The control is then designed by specifying the desired trajectories with respect to the object and forming the control error in the end-effector frame. The implementation using a distributed computer architecture is described. An experimental system has been built and used to evaluate the performance of the POSE estimation and the position based visual servo control. Several results for relative trajectory control and target tracking are presented. Results of the experiments showing the effect of loss of some of the redundant features are also presented.},

Several, including SIASUN, are also targeting service robots. I recently saw SIASUN products that could be used in elder care, an exciting development given the great need for advances in this area. Kidwell, said also some of the headaches in robot applications are setup and deployment. The typical setup time of a UR robot is around half a day, which is much shorter than most robot applications, as many of them require a lot of work with setting up peripherals and getting them running.

	abstract = {Despite the food industry being a leading sector of the European economy, the level of penetration of automation is still low. The main reasons lie on the small margin of food items which does not encourage technological investments, the extremely spread vendors market i.e. mostly small and medium enterprises, and the high level of flexibility and care required to handle food products along production, packaging, and storage operations. Nevertheless, the advent of collaborative, small and flexible robots provides great opportunities for the design and development of new effective processes integrating the human flexibility with the efficiency of automation. This paper explores the impact of adopting collaborative robots in the food catering industry, by illustrating a case study developed for the end-of-line of a catering production system. A generalizable methodology is proposed to support the study of the technical and economic feasibility of the implementation of such technology. This methodology is intended to support managers of the food industry to analyse the constraints that limit the automation of a process and to measure the expected performance of the system in terms of throughput, ergonomics and economic benefits resulting from the adoption of collaborative robots.},

	abstract = {Up to now, industrial robots were considered as machines working for humans. In this sense, programming required special coding knowledge and skills as teaching approaches were based on imperative programming methods, formulating the solving of a problem line by line. As novel work principles consider the robot rather a tool, assisting or collaborating with the human, declarative approaches are needed, that allow for intuitiveness and modifiability. Collaborative robot (cobot) control requires intuitive interfaces, not only for ease of use but also for modifying existing execution programs. Furthermore, the increasingly diverse personnel also requires a more democratic approach to robot programming. However, there is no standard or guideline for intuitive cobot control, and it can be noticed that the usability of the diverse interfaces and systems provided on the market is rather poor. This paper compares three systems with their advantages and disadvantages concerning usability and presents the results of the standard usability score (SUS) test, which was conducted in the Vienna learning factory “TU Wien Pilot Factory for Industry 4.0”. Additionally, the paper presents an approach on how to teach different levels of cobot interaction and control addressing the skill sets needed in their individual working environments.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robots (cobots) have been increasingly adopted in industries to facilitate human–robot collaboration. Despite this, it is challenging to program cobots for collaborative industrial tasks as the programming has two distinct elements that are difficult to implement: (1) an intuitive element to ensure that the operations of a cobot can be composed or altered dynamically by an operator, and (2) a human-aware element to support cobots in producing flexible and adaptive behaviours dependent on human partners. In this area, some research works have been carried out recently, but there is a lack of a systematic summary on the subject. In this paper, an overview of collaborative industrial scenarios and programming requirements for cobots to implement effective collaboration is given. Then, detailed reviews on cobot programming, which are categorised into communication, optimisation, and learning, are conducted. Additionally, a significant gap between cobot programming implemented in industry and in research is identified, and research that works towards bridging this gap is pinpointed. Finally, the future directions of cobots for industrial collaborative scenarios are outlined, including potential points of extension and improvement.},

	doi = {10.1109/LRA.2019.2931248},
	abstract = {In this letter, we address the problem of extracting a feasible set of dynamic parameters characterizing the dynamics of a robot manipulator. We start by identifying through an ordinary least squares approach the dynamic coefficients that linearly parametrize the model. From these, we retrieve a set of feasible link parameters (mass, position of center of mass, inertia) that is fundamental for more realistic dynamic simulations or when implementing in real time robot control laws using recursive Newton-Euler algorithms. The resulting problem is solved by means of an optimization method that incorporates constraints on the physical consistency of the dynamic parameters, including the triangle inequality of the link inertia tensors as well as other user-defined, possibly nonlinear constraints. The approach is developed for the increasingly popular Panda robot by Franka Emika, identifying for the first time its dynamic coefficients, an accurate joint friction model, and a set of feasible dynamic parameters. Validation of the identified dynamic model and of the retrieved feasible parameters is presented for the inverse dynamics problem using, respectively, a Lagrangian approach and Newton-Euler computations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an industrial cloud robotics distributed application that was executed across a high-speed wide-area network. The application was implemented using ROS libraries and packages. The purpose of the application is to enable an industrial robot to perform surface blending. A Kinect sensor, a surface blending tool and a laser scanner are mounted on the robot arm. The arm is moved under software control to scan a work bench on which metal parts of variable size can be laid out at any orientation. The collected point cloud data is processed by a segmentation algorithm to find the surface boundaries. A Cartesian path planning algorithm is executed to determine paths for the robot arm to execute the blending action and a laser scan on a selected surface. A new ROS package was implemented to collect CPU, memory and bandwidth usage for each significant ROS node in this distributed application. To emulate a scenario in which computing resources at a remote datacenter can be used for the segmentation and path planning algorithms in conjunction with the robots located on a factory floor, a software-defined network testbed called GENI was used to distribute compute-heavy ROS nodes. Measurements show that with TCP tuning, and high-speed end-to-end paths, the total execution time in the Cloud scenario can be reasonably close to a local scenario in which computing is collocated with the robot.},

	abstract = {This book is devoted to one of the most famous examples of automation handling tasks – the “bin-picking” problem. To pick up objects, scrambled in a box is an easy task for humans, but its automation is very complex. In this book three different approaches to solve the bin-picking problem are described, showing how modern sensors can be used for efficient bin-picking as well as how classic sensor concepts can be applied for novel bin-picking techniques. 3D point clouds are firstly used as basis, employing the known Random Sample Matching algorithm paired with a very efficient depth map based collision avoidance mechanism resulting in a very robust bin-picking approach. Reducing the complexity of the sensor data, all computations are then done on depth maps. This allows the use of 2D image analysis techniques to fulfill the tasks and results in real time data analysis. Combined with force/torque and acceleration sensors, a near time optimal bin-picking system emerges. Lastly, surface normal maps are employed as a basis for pose estimation. In contrast to known approaches, the normal maps are not used for 3D data computation but directly for the object localization problem, enabling the application of a new class of sensors for bin-picking.},
