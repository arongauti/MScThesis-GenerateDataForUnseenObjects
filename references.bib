	abstract = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features:  Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/  Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.},

	abstract = {Automation entails many previously unforeseen problems. As the unfathomable processing power of the human mind creates the illusion that detecting and picking up objects is,in some way, an easy task. Distinguishing objects from other identical objects, often only in one color, is not as easy as one might think.The task at hand is to reduce the time it takes to train a neural network to recognize each object in large warehouses, and annotate thousands of images to do so.Going through the process of finding a good dataset to use in a series of experiments, this thesis aims to answer the question if it is possible to use a minimal dataset to train a neural network that can detect a more comprehensive array of objects. Through incremental and batch learning procedure, experiments are done with different methods of training and detecting objects. From the results of these experiments, it can be concluded that there is a possibility that a network can be made to detect a large variety of objects by only training the network on a portion of the catalog at hand.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete design methodology for Cartesian position based visual servo control for robots with a single camera mounted at the end-effector. Position based visual servo control requires the explicit calculation of the relative position and orientation (POSE) of the workpiece object with respect to the camera. This is accomplished using image plane measurements of a number of known feature points on the object, and then applying an extended Kalman filter to obtain a recursive solution of the photogrammetric equations, and to properly combine redundant measurements. The control is then designed by specifying the desired trajectories with respect to the object and forming the control error in the end-effector frame. The implementation using a distributed computer architecture is described. An experimental system has been built and used to evaluate the performance of the POSE estimation and the position based visual servo control. Several results for relative trajectory control and target tracking are presented. Results of the experiments showing the effect of loss of some of the redundant features are also presented.},

	abstract = {There are a huge number of features which are said to improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accuracy. Practical testing of combinations of such features on large datasets, and theoretical justification of the result, is required. Some features operate on certain models exclusively and for certain problems exclusively, or only for small-scale datasets; while some features, such as batch-normalization and residual-connections, are applicable to the majority of models, tasks, and datasets. We assume that such universal features include Weighted-Residual-Connections (WRC), Cross-Stage-Partial-connections (CSP), Cross mini-Batch Normalization (CmBN), Self-adversarial-training (SAT) and Mish-activation. We use new features: WRC, CSP, CmBN, SAT, Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, and CIoU loss, and combine some of them to achieve state-of-the-art results: 43.5\% AP (65.7\% AP50) for the MS COCO dataset at a realtime speed of {\textasciitilde}65 FPS on Tesla V100.

This article examines the nature of the relationship between Precision and Recall. The relationships between Recall and the number of documents retrieved, between Precision and the number of documents retrieved, and between Precision and Recall are described in the context of different assumptions about retrieval performance. It is demonstrated that a tradeoff between Recall and Precision is unavoidable whenever retrieval performance is consistently better than retrieval at random. More generally, for the Precision–Recall trade-off to be avoided as the total number of documents retrieved increases, retrieval performance must be equal to or better than overall retrieval performance up to that point. Examination of the mathematical relationship between Precision and Recall shows that a quadratic Recall curve can resemble empirical Recall–Precision behavior if transformed into a tangent parabola. With very large databases and/or systems with limited retrieval capabilities there can be advantages to retrieval in two stages: Initial retrieval emphasizing high Recall, followed by more detailed searching of the initially retrieved set, can be used to improve both Recall and Precision simultaneously. Even so, a tradeoff between Precision and Recall remains. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robots (cobots) have been increasingly adopted in industries to facilitate human–robot collaboration. Despite this, it is challenging to program cobots for collaborative industrial tasks as the programming has two distinct elements that are difficult to implement: (1) an intuitive element to ensure that the operations of a cobot can be composed or altered dynamically by an operator, and (2) a human-aware element to support cobots in producing flexible and adaptive behaviours dependent on human partners. In this area, some research works have been carried out recently, but there is a lack of a systematic summary on the subject. In this paper, an overview of collaborative industrial scenarios and programming requirements for cobots to implement effective collaboration is given. Then, detailed reviews on cobot programming, which are categorised into communication, optimisation, and learning, are conducted. Additionally, a significant gap between cobot programming implemented in industry and in research is identified, and research that works towards bridging this gap is pinpointed. Finally, the future directions of cobots for industrial collaborative scenarios are outlined, including potential points of extension and improvement.},

	abstract = {Despite the food industry being a leading sector of the European economy, the level of penetration of automation is still low. The main reasons lie on the small margin of food items which does not encourage technological investments, the extremely spread vendors market i.e. mostly small and medium enterprises, and the high level of flexibility and care required to handle food products along production, packaging, and storage operations. Nevertheless, the advent of collaborative, small and flexible robots provides great opportunities for the design and development of new effective processes integrating the human flexibility with the efficiency of automation. This paper explores the impact of adopting collaborative robots in the food catering industry, by illustrating a case study developed for the end-of-line of a catering production system. A generalizable methodology is proposed to support the study of the technical and economic feasibility of the implementation of such technology. This methodology is intended to support managers of the food industry to analyse the constraints that limit the automation of a process and to measure the expected performance of the system in terms of throughput, ergonomics and economic benefits resulting from the adoption of collaborative robots.},

	abstract = {Up to now, industrial robots were considered as machines working for humans. In this sense, programming required special coding knowledge and skills as teaching approaches were based on imperative programming methods, formulating the solving of a problem line by line. As novel work principles consider the robot rather a tool, assisting or collaborating with the human, declarative approaches are needed, that allow for intuitiveness and modifiability. Collaborative robot (cobot) control requires intuitive interfaces, not only for ease of use but also for modifying existing execution programs. Furthermore, the increasingly diverse personnel also requires a more democratic approach to robot programming. However, there is no standard or guideline for intuitive cobot control, and it can be noticed that the usability of the diverse interfaces and systems provided on the market is rather poor. This paper compares three systems with their advantages and disadvantages concerning usability and presents the results of the standard usability score (SUS) test, which was conducted in the Vienna learning factory “TU Wien Pilot Factory for Industry 4.0”. Additionally, the paper presents an approach on how to teach different levels of cobot interaction and control addressing the skill sets needed in their individual working environments.},

Several, including SIASUN, are also targeting service robots. I recently saw SIASUN products that could be used in elder care, an exciting development given the great need for advances in this area. Kidwell, said also some of the headaches in robot applications are setup and deployment.

	abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network.

	abstract = {Computer vision applications are rapidly gaining popularity in embedded systems, which typically involve a difficult tradeoff between vision performance and energy consumption under a constraint of real-time processing throughput. Recently, hardware (FPGA and ASIC-based) implementations have emerged, which significantly improves the energy efficiency of vision computation. These implementations, however, often involve intensive memory traffic that retains a significant portion of energy consumption at the system level. To address this issue, we are the first researchers to present a lossy compression framework to exploit the tradeoff between vision performance and memory traffic for input images. To meet various requirements for memory access patterns in the vision system, a line-to-block format conversion is designed for the framework. Differential pulse-code modulation-based gradient-oriented quantization is developed as the lossy compression algorithm. We also present its hardware design that supports up to 12-scale 1080p@60fps real-time processing. For histogram of oriented gradient-based deformable part models on VOC2007, the proposed framework achieves a 49.6\%-60.5\% memory traffic reduction at a detection rate degradation of 0.05\%-0.34\%. For AlexNet on ImageNet, memory traffic reduction achieves up to 60.8\% with less than 0.61\% classification rate degradation. Compared with the power consumption reduction from memory traffic, the overhead involved for the proposed input image compression is less than 5\%.},

	abstract = {This article presents a robotic pick-and-place system that is capable of grasping and recognizing both known and novel objects in cluttered environments. The key new feature of the system is that it handles a wide range of object categories without needing any task-specific training data for novel objects. To achieve this, it first uses an object-agnostic grasping framework to map from visual observations to actions: inferring dense pixel-wise probability maps of the affordances for four different grasping primitive actions. It then executes the action with the highest affordance and recognizes picked objects with a cross-domain image classification framework that matches observed images to product images. Since product images are readily available for a wide range of objects (e.g., from the web), the system works out-of-the-box for novel objects without requiring any additional data collection or re-training. Exhaustive experimental results demonstrate that our multi-affordance grasping achieves high success rates for a wide variety of objects in clutter, and our recognition algorithm achieves high accuracy for both known and novel grasped objects. The approach was part of the MIT–Princeton Team system that took first place in the stowing task at the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge.

	abstract = {This book is devoted to one of the most famous examples of automation handling tasks – the “bin-picking” problem. To pick up objects, scrambled in a box is an easy task for humans, but its automation is very complex. In this book three different approaches to solve the bin-picking problem are described, showing how modern sensors can be used for efficient bin-picking as well as how classic sensor concepts can be applied for novel bin-picking techniques. 3D point clouds are firstly used as basis, employing the known Random Sample Matching algorithm paired with a very efficient depth map based collision avoidance mechanism resulting in a very robust bin-picking approach. Reducing the complexity of the sensor data, all computations are then done on depth maps. This allows the use of 2D image analysis techniques to fulfill the tasks and results in real time data analysis. Combined with force/torque and acceleration sensors, a near time optimal bin-picking system emerges. Lastly, surface normal maps are employed as a basis for pose estimation. In contrast to known approaches, the normal maps are not used for 3D data computation but directly for the object localization problem, enabling the application of a new class of sensors for bin-picking.},

	abstract = {In order to function in unstructured environments, robots need the ability to recognize unseen objects. We take a step in this direction by tackling the problem of segmenting unseen object instances in tabletop environments. However, the type of large-scale real-world dataset required for this task typically does not exist for most robotic settings, which motivates the use of synthetic data. Our proposed method, unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS)-Net, separately leverages synthetic RGB and synthetic depth for unseen object instance segmentation. UOIS-Net is composed of two stages: first, it operates only on depth to produce object instance center votes in 2D or 3D and assembles them into rough initial masks. Second, these initial masks are refined using RGB. Surprisingly, our framework is able to learn from synthetic RGB-D data where the RGB is nonphotorealistic. To train our method, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of random objects on tabletops. We show that our method can produce sharp and accurate segmentation masks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on unseen object instance segmentation. We also show that our method can segment unseen objects for robot grasping.},

However, most methods have strict restrictions on the captured image quality, so they cannot meet the application requirements of the substation. In this paper, a versatile pointer meter detection and recognition system based on computer vision is proposed for different environments. A Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) is first used to detect the position of the target meter and the camera is adjusted according to the detection box. Then, thanks to the feature correspondence algorithm and the Perspective Transform, the problem of specular reflection and image distortion is solved to obtain high quality images. Finally, reading can be obtained after the position of pointer detected by Hough Transform. The experimental results verify the stability and accuracy of recognition system which is proved to work well under different conditions.},

	abstract = {The computer vision (CV) paradigm is introduced to improve the computational and processing system efficiencies through visual inputs. These visual inputs are processed using sophisticated techniques for improving the reliability of human–machine interactions (HMIs). The processing of visual inputs requires multi-level data computations for achieving application-specific reliability. Therefore, in this paper, a two-level visual information processing (2LVIP) method is introduced to meet the reliability requirements of HMI applications. The 2LVIP method is used for handling both structured and unstructured data through classification learning to extract the maximum gain from the inputs. The introduced method identifies the gain-related features on its first level and optimizes the features to improve information gain. In the second level, the error is reduced through a regression process to stabilize the precision to meet the HMI application demands. The two levels are interoperable and fully connected to achieve better gain and precision through the reduction in information processing errors. The analysis results show that the proposed method achieves 9.42\% higher information gain and a 6.51\% smaller error under different classification instances compared with conventional methods.},

	abstract = {In pattern recognition, information retrieval and classification (machine learning), precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. Both precision and recall are therefore based on relevance.
Suppose a computer program for recognizing dogs (the relevant element) in photographs identifies eight dogs in a picture containing ten cats and twelve dogs, and of the eight it identifies as dogs, five actually are dogs (true positives), while the other three are cats (false positives). Seven dogs were missed (false negatives), and seven cats were correctly excluded (true negatives). The program's precision is then 5/8 (true positives / all positives) while its recall is 5/12 (true positives / relevant elements).
When a search engine returns 30 pages, only 20 of which are relevant, while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3, which tells us how valid the results are, while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3, which tells us how complete the results are.
Adopting a hypothesis-testing approach from statistics, in which, in this case, the null hypothesis is that a given item is irrelevant, i.e., not a dog, absence of type I and type II errors (i.e. perfect specificity and sensitivity of 100\% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative).  
More generally, recall is simply the complement of the type II error rate, i.e., one minus the type II error rate. Precision is related to the type I error rate, but in a slightly more complicated way, as it also depends upon the prior distribution of seeing a relevant vs an irrelevant item.
The above cat and dog example contained 8 − 5 = 3 type I errors, for a type I error rate of 3/10, and 12 − 5 = 7 type II errors, for a type II error rate of 7/12.  Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. 
Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).},

However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features:  Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/  Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.

From these, we retrieve a set of feasible link parameters (mass, position of center of mass, inertia) that is fundamental for more realistic dynamic simulations or when implementing in real time robot control laws using recursive Newton-Euler algorithms. The resulting problem is solved by means of an optimization method that incorporates constraints on the physical consistency of the dynamic parameters, including the triangle inequality of the link inertia tensors as well as other user-defined, possibly nonlinear constraints. The approach is developed for the increasingly popular Panda robot by Franka Emika, identifying for the first time its dynamic coefficients, an accurate joint friction model, and a set of feasible dynamic parameters. Validation of the identified dynamic model and of the retrieved feasible parameters is presented for the inverse dynamics problem using, respectively, a Lagrangian approach and Newton-Euler computations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an industrial cloud robotics distributed application that was executed across a high-speed wide-area network. The application was implemented using ROS libraries and packages. The purpose of the application is to enable an industrial robot to perform surface blending. A Kinect sensor, a surface blending tool and a laser scanner are mounted on the robot arm. The arm is moved under software control to scan a work bench on which metal parts of variable size can be laid out at any orientation. The collected point cloud data is processed by a segmentation algorithm to find the surface boundaries. A Cartesian path planning algorithm is executed to determine paths for the robot arm to execute the blending action and a laser scan on a selected surface. A new ROS package was implemented to collect CPU, memory and bandwidth usage for each significant ROS node in this distributed application. To emulate a scenario in which computing resources at a remote datacenter can be used for the segmentation and path planning algorithms in conjunction with the robots located on a factory floor, a software-defined network testbed called GENI was used to distribute compute-heavy ROS nodes. Measurements show that with TCP tuning, and high-speed end-to-end paths, the total execution time in the Cloud scenario can be reasonably close to a local scenario in which computing is collocated with the robot.},
